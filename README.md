# Taking A Challenge A Desktop ISO for Server Setup Instead Of Server ISO

## Introduction

In this project, I explore the intriguing challenge of setting up a server using a desktop ISO instead of the conventional server ISO. My blog post, **"Why Do We Need a Server ISO? Canâ€™t We Make a Server Using a Desktop ISO?"** outlines my journey of configuring a Nextcloud server on an old Acer laptop running Ubuntu.

## Why a Desktop ISO?

While server ISOs are optimized for performance and resource management, I discovered that a desktop ISO can effectively serve as a powerful server environment. This approach not only provided me with a unique learning experience but also reinforced the importance of adaptability and creativity in problem-solving.

## Key Highlights

- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Detailed instructions on how to set up a Nextcloud server using a desktop ISO, including system updates, package installations, and Apache configuration.
- **Troubleshooting**: Insights into common issues faced during the setup, such as PHP compatibility problems, and how I resolved them.
- **Security Measures**: Implementation of SSL certificates and data storage expansion through external SSD mounting.

## Installation Steps

1. **Update Your System**
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   ```
   sudo apt install apache2 mariadb-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php-xml php-curl php-zip php-gd php-mbstring php-intl php-bcmath
   ```

3. **Configure the Database**
   ```
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
   CREATE USER 'nextclouduser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextclouduser'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   EXIT;
   ```

4. **Download Nextcloud**
   ```
   wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-x.y.z.zip
   unzip nextcloud-x.y.z.zip
   sudo mv nextcloud /var/www/html/
   ```

5. **Configure Apache**
   - Create a new virtual host configuration file.
   - Enable the site and necessary Apache modules.

6. **Access Nextcloud**
   - Access Nextcloud through your browser using the local IP address.

7. **Complete the Setup**
   - Enter the database details and create an admin account.

8. **Security Configuration**
   - Implement SSL certificates or create self-signed certificates.

9. **Mounting the External SSD for Storage**
   - Identify and mount the external SSD to expand storage capacity.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an encouragement for fellow learners and enthusiasts to explore unconventional methods in technology. I hope that by sharing my experience, I can inspire others to embrace challenges and find innovative solutions in their own tech journeys.
